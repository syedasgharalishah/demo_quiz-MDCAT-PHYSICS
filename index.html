Since $P$ is constant, $P dt = mv dv$. Integrating, $Pt = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\implies v = \\sqrt{2Pt/m}$. Since $v = dx/dt$, $dx = v dt = \\sqrt{2P/m} t^{1/2} dt$.

If $P' = 2P$ and $v' = v/2$, then $2P = F'(v/2) \\implies F' = 4P/v = 4(P/v) = 4F$. So, the force becomes four times." },

The work done by the gravitational force over one complete orbit is:", options: ["Positive", "Negative", "Zero", "Depends on the satellite's speed"], correctOptionIndex: 2, explanation: "Gravitational force is a conservative force.

At max height, $KE_{final}=0$. Initial $KE_{initial} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$. Work by gravity $W_{gravity} = -mgh$. So $-mgh + W_{air\\_res} = 0 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\implies W_{air\\_res} = mgh - \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = -( \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - mgh)$." },

This implies that:", options: ["The system is isolated.", "Conservative forces are doing positive work.", "Non-conservative forces are doing work.", "The system's kinetic energy is increasing."], correctOptionIndex: 2, explanation: "A decrease in mechanical energy indicates that energy is being dissipated, typically due to non-conservative forces like friction, air resistance, or damping, which convert mechanical energy into other forms such as heat or sound."},

At which point is its acceleration maximum?", options: ["Lowest point", "Highest point", "Halfway between lowest and highest", "Acceleration is constant"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "At the highest (extreme) points, the pendulum momentarily stops, so its velocity is zero.
